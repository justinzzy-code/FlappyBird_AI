# FlappyBird_AI
Ensure you have the libaries in requirements.txt. Note that the code may not run on python 3.9. 

To train the AI for flappy bird, run ai_creation.py.

I have uploaded an AI that I have trained. You can run ai_load.py to see the results. There is also a demo video of the AI I have created.
# Enjoy!
